Can you transform(serialize) a binary tree into a string and restore(deserialize) a binary tree from the string? Just like what JSON.stringify() and JSON.parse() do.

For example, for a tree from 91. invert a binary tree


BFE.dev would serialize it to [1,2,3,4,null,null,5,6,7,8,null,null,null,null,9]

But there are more ways of doing it rather than above, any would be fine as long as your deserialize() and serialize() work as a pair.

Your code is tested like this:

const tree1 = ...
expect(typeof serialize(tree1)).toBe('string')
const tree2 = deserialize(serialize(tree1)) 
expect(isIdentical(tree1, tree2)).toBe(true)
Binary tree in this problem consists of value of integers.

 difference between json stringfy and json parse


JSON.stringify and JSON.parse are two methods used for working with JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) in JavaScript:

JSON.stringify:

Purpose: Converts a JavaScript object or value to a JSON string.
Usage: Useful for sending data to a server or storing it as a string.

Sure! Let’s break down the problem of serializing and deserializing a binary tree, using diagrams and examples.

Binary Tree Structure
A binary tree consists of nodes, where each node has at most two children: a left child and a right child. Here’s a simple example:

markdown
Copy code
       1
      / \
     2   3
    / \
   4   5
Serialization
Serialization is the process of converting a binary tree into a string format. The goal is to represent the structure and values of the tree so that it can be easily stored or transmitted.

One common way to serialize is using Level Order Traversal (BFS). Here’s how it looks for the above tree:

Traverse level by level from top to bottom and left to right.
Use null for missing nodes.
For our example tree, the serialized string could look like this:

graphql
Copy code
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, null, null]
Deserialization
Deserialization is the process of converting the serialized string back into the original binary tree structure.

To deserialize, we can follow the same level order traversal, reconstructing the tree as we read the values from the string.

Example Serialization and Deserialization Process
Given Tree:

markdown
Copy code
       1
      / \
     2   3
    / \
   4   5
Serialized Output:

arduino
Copy code
"[1,2,3,4,5,null,null,null,null]"
Deserialized Back to Tree:

Reconstructs the tree to its original structure.
Implementation in JavaScript
Now, let's write the functions to serialize and deserialize the binary tree.

javascript
Copy code
class TreeNode {
    constructor(val) {
        this.val = val;
        this.left = null;
        this.right = null;
    }
}

function serialize(root) {
    if (!root) return "[]";
    
    const result = [];
    const queue = [root];
    
    while (queue.length) {
        const node = queue.shift();
        if (node) {
            result.push(node.val);
            queue.push(node.left);
            queue.push(node.right);
        } else {
            result.push(null);
        }
    }
    
    // Remove trailing nulls
    while (result[result.length - 1] === null) {
        result.pop();
    }
    
    return JSON.stringify(result);
}

function deserialize(data) {
    if (data === "[]") return null;
    
    const values = JSON.parse(data);
    const root = new TreeNode(values[0]);
    const queue = [root];
    
    let i = 1;
    
    while (queue.length) {
        const node = queue.shift();
        
        if (values[i] !== null) {
            node.left = new TreeNode(values[i]);
            queue.push(node.left);
        }
        i++;
        
        if (i < values.length && values[i] !== null) {
            node.right = new TreeNode(values[i]);
            queue.push(node.right);
        }
        i++;
    }
    
    return root;
}

// Example of testing
const tree1 = new TreeNode(1);
tree1.left = new TreeNode(2);
tree1.right = new TreeNode(3);
tree1.left.left = new TreeNode(4);
tree1.left.right = new TreeNode(5);

const serialized = serialize(tree1);
console.log(serialized); // Output: "[1,2,3,4,5]"

const tree2 = deserialize(serialized);
console.log(serialize(tree2)); // Should match the serialized output
Explanation of the Code
TreeNode Class: Represents each node in the binary tree.
serialize Function:
Uses a queue to perform level order traversal.
Collects node values, inserting null for missing nodes.
Converts the result to a JSON string.
deserialize Function:
Parses the JSON string back into an array.
Reconstructs the tree using a queue to maintain the structure.
Testing: Creates a sample tree, serializes it, and then deserializes it back to check if the original tree structure is preserved.
Conclusion
This approach efficiently serializes and deserializes a binary tree, preserving its structure and values. You can test it with different binary trees to ensure it works in all cases!

To understand the serialization and deserialization of a binary tree using the provided code, let's break down the logic and thought process behind it step-by-step.

Key Concepts
Binary Tree Structure:

A binary tree consists of nodes, where each node can have at most two children (left and right).
Each node contains a value, and in this case, we assume it’s an integer.
Serialization:

The goal of serialization is to convert the binary tree into a string format.
We can choose any delimiter to separate values; here, we’re using commas.
A placeholder (like _) is used for null nodes (missing children)./
function deserialize(str){
  let q= str.split(',');
  return dfs(q);
  function dfs(queue){
    if (!queue.length) return null;
    const n = queue.shift();
    if(n!=='_'){
      const node= new Node(n.value);
      node.left= dfs(q)
      node.right= dfs(q);
      return node;
      
    }
    return null;
  }
}

function serialize(root){
  if(!root) return '_';
  return `${root.value},${serialize(root.left)${serialize(root.right)`
  }

  

                                                                                */
