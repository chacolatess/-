In JavaScript, the shift and solut methods are not both standard methods. Here's a breakdown of shift and clarification about solut:

shift()
Definition: shift() is a method of the Array prototype.
Functionality: It removes the first element from an array and returns that element. This method changes the length of the array.
Usage:
javascript
Copy code
let array = [1, 2, 3];
let firstElement = array.shift(); // firstElement is 1
console.log(array); // array is now [2, 3]
solut
Clarification: There is no standard solut method in JavaScript. If you meant something else or a specific library function, please provide more details.

let str = "Hello, World!";
let result = str.split(", "); // Splits at ", "
console.log(result); // ["Hello", "World!"]

let numbers = "1,2,3,4,5";
let numArray = numbers.split(","); // Splits at ","
console.log(numArray); // ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5"]

let limitedSplit = str.split(" ", 1); // Limits to 1 split
console.log(limitedSplit); // ["Hello,"]
