In JavaScript, the shift and solut methods are not both standard methods. Here's a breakdown of shift and clarification about solut:

shift()
Definition: shift() is a method of the Array prototype.
Functionality: It removes the first element from an array and returns that element. This method changes the length of the array.
Usage:
javascript
Copy code
let array = [1, 2, 3];
let firstElement = array.shift(); // firstElement is 1
console.log(array); // array is now [2, 3]
solut
Clarification: There is no standard solut method in JavaScript. If you meant something else or a specific library function, please provide more details.
